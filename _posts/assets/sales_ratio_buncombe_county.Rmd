**True Value:** Market value, that is, the price estimated in terms of money at which the property would change hands between a willing and financially able buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all the uses to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used (NC G.S. 105-283)

**Sales Ratio:** The ratio of the assessor's estimated Fair Cash Value in year t to that property's sale price in period tÂ±zt:
