**Urban3 takes a different approach to land value economics, property and retail tax analysis and community design.** We empower communities with new insights into their own data. Our work makes a quantifiable case for better city planning, urban design and smarter growth. And we back up our stories with research and numbers.

**We make the complex human.** We demystify tax codes, government jargon, and municipal finance data, allowing communities to clearly understand the economic impact of development.
